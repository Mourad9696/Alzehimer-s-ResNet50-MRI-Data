# Alzehimer-s-ResNet50-MRI-Data
Deep Learning-Based Automated Detection and Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using Neuroimaging Data

Project Description:
This project focuses on the development of a deep learning-based system for automated detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using neuroimaging data, specifically MRI scans. The goal is to provide an efficient and accurate tool for early diagnosis and classification of AD, which can greatly aid in timely intervention and treatment planning.

Key Features:

Neuroimaging Data Processing: The project includes a comprehensive pipeline for preprocessing and feature extraction from MRI scans. Various techniques such as image normalization, registration, and segmentation are employed to extract relevant features from the scans.

Deep Learning Model Selection: The ResNet50 architecture has been chosen as the primary deep learning model for classification due to its excellent performance in previous studies. ResNet50's ability to learn intricate patterns and its depth make it well-suited for the complex task of AD classification.

Multi-Class Classification: The system is designed to classify MRI scans into four categories: 'CN' (cognitively normal), 'MCI' (mild cognitive impairment), 'LMCI' (late mild cognitive impairment), and 'AD' (Alzheimer's disease). The model is trained using labeled datasets with accurate ground truth labels.

Model Training and Evaluation: A rigorous training and evaluation process is followed to optimize the performance of the ResNet50 model. The training dataset is utilized to train the model, and the testing dataset is used for evaluating its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

User-Friendly Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload MRI scans and obtain automated classification results. The interface provides visualizations and summary statistics to facilitate interpretation and understanding of the classification outcomes.

Open-Source and Reproducible: The entire project, including the codebase, pre-trained models, and labeled datasets, is made available as an open-source resource on GitHub. This promotes transparency, collaboration, and reproducibility of the research, enabling others to build upon and validate the findings.

This project aims to contribute to the ongoing research in Alzheimer's disease detection and classification by providing a robust and accurate deep learning-based solution. The automated system has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improve the early diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease.
